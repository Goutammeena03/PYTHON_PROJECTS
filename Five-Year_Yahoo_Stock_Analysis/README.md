# Yahoo Stocks Analysis (2019-2024)

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of Yahoo Stocks over the past 5 years, focusing on key indicators and market trends. The analysis leverages moving averages, correlation metrics, and historical market events to provide insights into stock movements.

### Key Insights
##### Moving Averages as Indicators

1. The 50-day moving average (DMA) and 200-day moving average (DMA) are reliable indicators of stock movement.
2. Bullish Trend: When the closing price is above both the 50 and 200 DMA, the stock is typically in an uptrend.
3. Bearish Trend: Conversely, if the closing price is below these DMAs, the stock is usually on a downtrend.
4. Trend Reversal Points: Points where the 50 and 200 DMAs intersect often signal market trend reversals (e.g., high to low or low to high).
   
##### COVID-19 Impact
The significant dip in March 2020 is a clear indicator of the COVID-19 market crash, a historical downturn impacting global markets.

##### Correlation and Collinearity
1. The closing price has a very high correlation with most variables except for the volume.
2. There is strong multicollinearity among variables, suggesting interdependencies.

##### Modeling Insights
1. While achieving a good R² score and coefficients is positive, the high correlation (~1) among variables indicates potential pitfalls.
2. It's essential to be cautious when fitting models based on these highly correlated parameters in real-life scenarios.
